### Notes

Still had a lot of issues with drawables and accessing files from the secrets.xml. When I tried I got a null exception error. I will be taking this week to spend more time to work on UI design.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had some troubles styling the UI for the app. I also had some confusion between style and theme. Changing the color for the background to what I wanted didn't work as i planned so I improvised. Later hopefully I will be able to learn about the different things I could do.
